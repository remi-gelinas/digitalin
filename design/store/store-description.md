Digitalin is a heavily modified custom version of the stunningly elegant watchface [Minimalin] (https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/56f93a5361a01637e5000036)
Digitalin is and always will be open source software :D

Modifications to the original face include:
* A completely digital display, no analog
* Battery percentage and charging indicator
* Daily step count
* Small bluetooth disconnection indicator underneath time
* Digital time big enough to be seen easily, but not in the way

Please report any issues through the Github repository issue tracker

Current known issues:
* 24 hour time is mildly broked :D
