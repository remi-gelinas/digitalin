# digitalin

Digitalin is a custom, heavily modified version of the beautiful [Minimalin](https://github.com/groyoh/minimalin) watchface. <br></br>
Digitalin uses the original Nupe font, modified with added glyphs created from scratch with the original design in mind.

Modifications to the original face include:
* A completely digital display, no analog
* Customizable colors for information, time, and background
* Battery percentage and charging indicator
* Daily step count
* Small bluetooth disconnection indicator underneath time
* Digital time big enough to be seen easily, but not in the way


## Licenses

[MIT](LICENSE.md) for the code.
[OFL](design/font/LICENSE.md) for the Nupe font.

## Credits

The entire team behind Minimalin, for creating a stunning watchface. Without them, there would be nothing to modify :D
